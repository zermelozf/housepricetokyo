  </header>

  <section class="introduction">
    <p>
      It all started with a simple question: say you are looking at a 5000万円 property listing (on <a
        href="https://suumo.jp/">suumo.jp</a> for example),
      how much of that is the value of the house and how much is the land?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been looking at listings for a while already, and was getting serious about making an offer. But at the back
      of my mind, I was feeling frustrated that I didn't really understand what makes a property valuable in Tokyo. I
      mean, I'm no a real estate investor, nor are my friends and most of the people who take the leap
      and buy a family house in one of the 23 wards. So in that specific insntace, it's probably OK to not know, I
      suppose. But still, where there is data, there is a way!
    <p>
      So with that in mind, I started looking for a dataset covering the Tokyo rReal Estate Market and ended up
      uncovering
      the <a href="https://www.reinfolib.mlit.go.jp/">MLIT 不動産情報ライブラリ dataset</a>: a treasure trove!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following article, I'll use statistical analysis to try and understand what drives property value
      in Tokyo. I'll start by briefly describing the techniques and assumptions I made, and then spend the rest of
      the article presenting the results through various charts and graphs.
    </p>

    <p>I suppose some of you couldn't care less about Lasso Regression or the modeling assumptions, and so if that's the
      case you can skip directly to the <a href="#results">results section</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, let's dive in!
    </p>

    <section class="data-source">
      <h2>Modeling Tokyo Real Estate</h2>
      <p>
        The MLIT dataset is a treasure trove of information about the Tokyo real estate market. It contains over 100,000
        property records, with features ranging from location to building specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the variety of features available and my goal of understanding what drives value, I chose to stick with
        Linear Regression (for robustness and interpretability) and spend some time on modeling/feature engineering. So
        yes, this article is 100% LLM free!
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of modeling, I also kept it simple and made the following assumptions:
        - The price of a listing in the MLIT dataset is split between land and house value
        - The price of the house is proportional to the floor area and the building type and year of construction
        might increase or decrease the price per square meter
        - Similarily, the land value is proportional to the plot size, and the price per square meter might increase or
        decrease depending on the land characteristics such as shape, orientation, distance to the station, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following chart shows the evolution of land values in Tokyo from 2013 to 2024.
      </p>
    </section>

    <app-land-value-evolution-chart></app-land-value-evolution-chart>
    <p>
      As shown in the chart, both land and house values in Tokyo have shown significant upward trends,
      but with some interesting differences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Land Values:</strong> From 2013 to 2024, the average land value per square meter has
        increased from ¥425,101 to ¥619,906, representing a total increase of approximately 46%.
        This trend highlights the strong demand for land in Tokyo and the potential for long-term
        value appreciation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>House Values:</strong> House values have shown an even more dramatic increase, rising
        from ¥60,523 to ¥180,541 per square meter, representing a total increase of approximately
        198%. This suggests that the value of buildings themselves has increased significantly,
        possibly due to improvements in construction quality, energy efficiency, and modern amenities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The chart also reveals some interesting patterns, such as the temporary dip in land values in
      2014-2015, and the accelerated growth in both land and house values in recent years. These
      trends are important to consider when evaluating the potential return on investment in Tokyo's
      real estate market.

    <h2>Our Data-Driven Approach</h2>
    <p>
      To understand what truly drives property values in Tokyo, we analyzed extensive data from the MLIT using Lasso
      regression. This machine learning technique is particularly well-suited for our analysis because it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Identifies Key Factors:</strong> Lasso automatically selects the most important variables from hundreds
        of potential factors, helping us focus on what really matters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Handles Complex Relationships:</strong> It can capture both linear and non-linear relationships between
        variables, crucial for understanding the nuanced Tokyo real estate market.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Provides Quantifiable Insights:</strong> The model gives us precise coefficients that tell us exactly
        how much each factor affects property values.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our analysis included over 100,000 property records from across Tokyo, with features ranging from location
      characteristics to building specifications. The Lasso model helped us identify the most significant factors, which
      we'll explore in detail below.

    <h2>The Tokyo Property Landscape</h2>
    <p>
      Let's start by looking at the distribution of land values across Tokyo. The map below shows
      the relative value of land in different areas, based on data from the Ministry of Land,
      Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT).

    <h2>Key Factors Affecting Property Values</h2>
    <p>
      Our Lasso regression analysis identified several key factors that significantly influence property values in
      Tokyo. Let's explore each of these factors in detail, with insights directly from our machine learning model.
    </p>

    <div class="factor location">
      <h3>Location, Location, Location</h3>
      <p>
        The Lasso model confirmed what many already suspect: location is paramount in Tokyo's real estate market.
        However, it also revealed some surprising nuances about how different location factors interact with property
        values.
      </p>
      <h4>Walking Time to Station</h4>
      <p>
        One of the most significant findings from our Lasso analysis was the precise impact of walking time to the
        nearest train station. The model identified this as one of the strongest predictors of property value, with a
        clear non-linear relationship:
      </p>
      <app-walking-time-chart></app-walking-time-chart>
      <p>
        The Lasso coefficients revealed several key insights about walking time's impact:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Premium for Convenience:</strong> Properties within 5 minutes of a station command the highest
          premium, with Lasso coefficients showing values up to +¥124,758 per square meter above the reference point.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Steep Value Decline:</strong> The model identified a significant negative impact beyond 15 minutes,
          with properties 20+ minutes away showing decreases of over ¥500,000 per square meter. The Lasso coefficients
          helped us quantify this relationship, showing an average devaluation rate of approximately ¥15,000 per square
          meter per minute of additional walking time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complex Interactions:</strong> The Lasso model revealed that walking time interacts with other
          factors, such as station importance and train lines, creating variations in the impact at similar walking
          times.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="factor building-type">
      <h3>Building Type and Depreciation</h3>
      <p>
        Our Lasso regression analysis uncovered fascinating patterns in how different building materials depreciate over
        time. The model helped us quantify these relationships with remarkable precision:
      </p>
      <app-depreciation-graph></app-depreciation-graph>
      <p>
        The Lasso coefficients revealed several key insights about building depreciation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Initial Value Premiums:</strong> The model identified significant initial value differences:
          <ul>
            <li>Steel structures (鉄骨造): +¥93,437 per square meter</li>
            <li>Light steel structures (軽量鉄骨造): +¥56,795 per square meter</li>
            <li>Wooden structures (木造): -¥9,408 per square meter</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Depreciation Rates:</strong> Lasso helped us quantify the annual depreciation rates:
          <ul>
            <li>Light steel structures: -¥12,059 per square meter per year</li>
            <li>Steel structures: -¥8,526 per square meter per year</li>
            <li>Wooden structures: -¥8,197 per square meter per year</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Value Crossover Points:</strong> The model's coefficients allowed us to calculate precise crossover
          points where different building types become more or less valuable relative to each other.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="factor land-characteristics">
      <h3>Land Characteristics</h3>
      <p>
        The Lasso model identified several physical characteristics of land that significantly impact property values.
        Here's what the analysis revealed:
      </p>

      <h4>Floor Ratio (容積率)</h4>
      <p>
        Our Lasso regression showed a clear relationship between floor ratio and land value, with the model identifying
        specific thresholds where the impact changes:
      </p>
      <app-floor-ratio-chart></app-floor-ratio-chart>
      <p>
        The model's coefficients revealed that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ratios below 100% tend to decrease land value</li>
        <li>Ratios above 200% show increasingly positive impacts</li>
        <li>The relationship is non-linear, with diminishing returns at very high ratios</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Building Ratio (建ぺい率)</h4>
      <p>
        The Lasso analysis quantified the impact of building ratio on land value:
      </p>
      <app-building-ratio-chart></app-building-ratio-chart>
      <p>
        Key findings from the model's coefficients:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ratios below 60% decrease land value</li>
        <li>Higher ratios can significantly increase value</li>
        <li>The impact is more linear than floor ratio</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Land Shape</h4>
      <p>
        The Lasso model identified significant value differences based on land shape:
      </p>
      <app-land-shape-chart></app-land-shape-chart>
      <p>
        Using square-shaped land (正方形) as the reference, the model's coefficients showed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Landlocked properties (袋地等): -¥62,000+ per square meter</li>
        <li>Irregular shapes (不整形): -¥62,000+ per square meter</li>
        <li>Regular rectangular shapes (長方形): +¥2,900 per square meter</li>
        <li>Near-rectangular shapes (ほぼ長方形): +¥2,500 per square meter</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Land Orientation</h4>
      <p>
        The Lasso analysis revealed clear preferences for land orientation:
      </p>
      <app-land-orientation-chart></app-land-orientation-chart>
      <p>
        Using east-facing properties (東) as the reference, the model's coefficients showed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No road frontage (接面道路無): -¥238,000+ per square meter</li>
        <li>South-east facing (南東): +¥10,038 per square meter</li>
        <li>South facing (南): +¥9,022 per square meter</li>
      </ul>
