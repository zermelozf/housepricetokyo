      Buying a house in Tokyo can be a daunting task, especially for foreigners. In this series of articles,
      I'll guide you through the process using data and machine learning to make informed decisions.
      This first part focuses on understanding how property values are determined in Tokyo.

    <h2>The Tokyo Property Landscape</h2>
    <p>
      Let's start by looking at the distribution of land values across Tokyo. The map below shows
      the relative value of land in different areas, based on data from the Ministry of Land,
      Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT).

    <h2>Key Factors Affecting Property Values</h2>
    
    <div class="factor location">
      <h3>Location, Location, Location</h3>
      <p>
        As in any major city, location is the most significant factor in determining property values.
        Our analysis of MLIT data shows that properties in central Tokyo can be worth up to 150% more
        than similar properties in outer areas.

    </div>

    <div class="factor building-type">
      <h3>Building Type and Depreciation</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most interesting findings from our analysis is how different building materials
        depreciate over time. Using MLIT data, we were able to model the depreciation curves for
        wooden, concrete, and steel structures.
      </p>
      <div class="graph-container">
        <!-- Depreciation graph will go here -->
      </div>
      <p>
        As you can see, wooden structures depreciate much faster than concrete or steel buildings.
        This is an important consideration when evaluating older properties.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="factor land-characteristics">
      <h3>Land Characteristics</h3>
      <p>
        The characteristics of the land itself also play a significant role in property values.
        Our analysis shows that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Larger plots command a premium, but the value per square meter decreases as size increases</li>
        <li>South-facing properties are generally more valuable due to better sunlight exposure</li>
        <li>Irregularly shaped plots can be significantly less valuable than regular rectangular plots</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="graph-container">
        <!-- Land characteristics graphs will go here -->
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding these factors is crucial when evaluating properties in Tokyo. In the next part
      of this series, we'll look at how to use this knowledge to find good deals and avoid overpriced
      properties.

      Stay tuned for Part 2, where we'll dive into the actual property search process and show you
      how to use data to identify undervalued properties.
