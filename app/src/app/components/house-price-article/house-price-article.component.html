  <section class="introduction">
    <h2>The Background Story</h2>
    <p>
      It all started with a simple question: say you are looking at a 5000万円 property listing (on <a
        href="https://suumo.jp/">suumo.jp</a> for example),
      how much of that is the value of the house and how much is the land?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been looking at listings for a while already, and was getting serious about making an offer. But at the back
      of my mind, I was feeling frustrated that I didn't really understand what makes a property valuable in Tokyo. I
      mean, I'm no a real estate investor, nor are my friends and most of the people who take the leap
      and buy a family house in one of the 23 wards. So in that specific insntace, it's probably OK to not know, I
      suppose. But still, where there is data, there is a way!
    </p>
    <p>
      So with that in mind, I started looking for a dataset covering the Tokyo rReal Estate Market and ended up
      uncovering
      the <a href="https://www.reinfolib.mlit.go.jp/">MLIT 不動産情報ライブラリ dataset</a>: a treasure trove!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following article, I'll use statistical analysis to try and understand what drives property value
      in Tokyo. I'll start by briefly describing the techniques and assumptions I made, and then spend the rest of
      the article presenting the results through various charts and graphs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's dive in!

          The MLIT dataset is a treasure trove of information about the Tokyo real estate market. It contains over
          100,000 property records, with features ranging from location to building specifications.
        </p>
        <h3>Making some assumptions</h3>
        <p>
          Given the variety of features available and my goal of understanding what drives value, I chose to stick with
          Linear Regression (for robustness and interpretability) and spend some time on modeling/feature engineering.
          So yes, this article is 100% LLM free!
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of modeling, I also kept it simple and made the following assumptions:
        </p>
        <ul class="assumptions-list">
          <li>The price of a listing in the MLIT dataset is split between land and house value</li>
          <li>The price of the house is proportional to the floor area and the building type and year of construction
            might increase or decrease the price per square meter</li>
          <li>Similarily, the land value is proportional to the plot size, and the price per square meter might increase
            or decrease depending on the land characteristics such as shape, orientation, distance to the station, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The formula used for our Lasso regression model is the following:
        </p>
        <div class="formula-container">
          <div class="formula">
            <div class="math-content" [innerHTML]="'\\[y = \\text{P}(\\text{house}) + \\text{P}(\\text{land})\\]'">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        with
        <div class="formula-container">
          <div class="formula">
            <div #houseFormulaContainer class="math-content"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        and
        <div class="formula-container">
          <div class="formula">
            <div #landFormulaContainer class="math-content"></div>
          </div>
        </div>

        With this modeling, the interpretation should be pretty straightforward: all coefficients have a price per
        square
        meter unit, except for the <span class="math">$\alpha_m^2$</span> coefficients which aim to model the
        depreciation
        of the house over time and thus are expressed in price per square meter per year.

        <h3>Predictive power</h3>

        <p>
          To evaluate the predictive power of our model, I compared the performance of the refined model against a
          baseline Linear Regression by cross validating Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for 500 iterations.
          The histogram of results is shown below.
        </p>

        <app-model-scores-histogram></app-model-scores-histogram>

        <p>
          As you can see, the refined model is better than basline with a median of about ~20% on a test set vs ~34% for
          the baseline. While 20% average error is not bad, there is certainly room for improvement.
        </p>

        <h3>So?</h3>

        <p>It looks like we have a decent model. It is far from perfect but, for the purpose of the rest of this
          analysis,
          I'mm going to consider the model good enough and move on to the interpretation of the coefficients of the
          Lasso
          Regression.

  <section class="land-value-evolution" id="importance">
    <h2>The relative importance of different factors</h2>

    Before diving into the details of each factor, let's first look at the relative importance of each factor in
    determining property values in Tokyo. The chart below shows the average impact of each factor on the property value
    group on the value of a property.

    <app-importance-chart></app-importance-chart>

    <p>The chart above shows the relative importance of different factors in determining property values in Tokyo. As we
      can see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unsurprisingly, <strong>Plot Size</strong> and <strong>House Size</strong> have the highest impact on the
        value of a property. The bigger the pricier. And each square meter counts.</li>
      <li>Next is<strong>Neighborhood</strong>. In fact, as we'll see in the <a href="#location">location section</a>,
        this is just an average effect and the
        location of the property can have an even stronger impact on price for properties located in good neighborhoods.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Construction Type</strong>, <strong>Property Orientation</strong>, and <strong>Land Shape</strong>
        each coneach conrtibute modestly to the value of a property.</li>
      <li><strong>Building Age</strong> has the smallest influence among the factors analyzed, however, bear in mind
        that this factor is multiplied by age, so each year will add to the depreciation of the prperty and thus the
        total impact might be much higher. We will have a more detailed look in the section on <a
          href="#depreciation">depreciation</a>.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>When to buy?</h3>
    One factor not shown in the chart above is the <strong>time of purchase</strong>. The year the property is bought
    also has an impact on the price and, according to the model, the earlier the better. In fact, the model assesses
    that the annualized rate of price growth is about <strong>3.5%</strong> per year on average.

    <p>
      What neightboarhoud you buy in Tokyo can make a huge difference in the price you pay. Let's look at the impact of
      the neighborhood on the price of a property.

    <p class="caption">
      Interactive map showing land values across Tokyo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model has clearly picked up on the fact centrally located properties are more valuable. And great
      neighborhoods
      can set you back more than 1 million yen per square meter!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      But what about the other factors? Let's dive into the details.
    </p>

  <section class="factors-section" id="other-factors">
    <h2>Other factors</h2>

    <div class="factor building-type">
      <h3 id="depreciation">Building Type and Depreciation</h3>
      <p>
        The Lasso regression analysis also uncovered interesting patterns in how different building materials depreciate
        over
        time. The model helped us quantify these relationships:
      </p>
      <app-depreciation-graph></app-depreciation-graph>
      <p>
        <strong>Steel</strong> and <strong>Light Steel</strong> are unsurprisingly the most durable and thus cost the
        most. Interestingly however, they depreciate faster than wooden structures and while they retain an advantage
        overall for durability, the <strong>Wooden</strong> structures are faring surprisingly well in my opinion.
        Overall, the the model probably underestimates the lifetime construction materials. <span id="insight">In fact, the depreciation
        period for wood is probably closer to 22 years, 46 years for light, at least from an accounting perspective.</span>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box" #insightBox>
      <div class="insight-icon">
        <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
      </div>
      <div class="insight-content">
        <p>I wonder if the short lifetime of materials is an artifact of the model or a real effect. Please let me know if you have any insights on this!</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="factor convenience" id="convenience">
      <h3>The Price of Convenience</h3>
      <p>
        One interesting result from of the Lasso model is the precise quantification of the impact of walking time to
        the
        nearest train station.
      </p>
      <app-walking-time-chart></app-walking-time-chart>
      <p>
        In a variant of the model shown above, I allowed the <span class="math">$\beta$</span> coefficients associated
        to
        walk time to be dummy coded minute by minute. This would theoretically allow for a non-linear relationship to be
        picked up. However, as you can see in the chart, the relationship seems pretty stable and linear with each
        minute closer to the station will add about ¥10,000 per square meter to the price of the property. This means a
        100 square meter property will be worth about ¥10 million more if it's located right next to the station.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="factor ratios" id="ratios">
      <h3>The Construction Ratios</h3>

      <h4>Floor Ratio (容積率)</h4>

      <p>
        Let's be quick with this one. The floor ratio is the ratio of the total floor area of a building to the total
        land area of the property. It is a measure of how much of the land is used for building purposes and is a legal
        requirement when building. The higher the floor ratio, the bigger the house you can build on the property.
        Unsuprisingly, higher floor ratios are associated with higher property values.
      </p>
      <app-floor-ratio-chart></app-floor-ratio-chart>

      <h4>Building Ratio (建ぺい率)</h4>
      <p>
        This ratio is similar to the floor ratio but it is a measure of how much of the land is covered by the building
        and is also a legal requirement when building. The higher the building ratio, the more of the land is covered
        by the building and so the more expensive it is.
      </p>
      <app-building-ratio-chart></app-building-ratio-chart>

      <div class="factor shape-orientation" id="shape">
        <h3>Land Shape and Orientation</h3>
        <h4>Land Shape</h4>
        <p>
          The learnt coefficients seem consistent with the intuition that square-shaped land is more valuable than
          irregularly shaped land. Also, the model is flagging landlocked properties (袋地等) as much less valuable.
          This is an important factor to take into account and sometimes the reason that explains why a listing on
          <a href="https://suumo.jp/">suumo.jp</a> is so cheap.
        </p>
        <app-land-shape-chart></app-land-shape-chart>

        <h4>Land Orientation</h4>
        <p>
          Land orientation does not seem to have a big impact on the price of a property. However, you should definitely
          avoid properties with no access (接面道路無). These types of properies are often not buildable anymore due to a
          change is legislation and so the value of the land is dramatically decreased (for good reason)..
