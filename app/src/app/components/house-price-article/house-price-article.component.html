  <section class="introduction">
    <p>
      Buying a house in Tokyo can be a daunting task, especially for foreigners. In this series of articles,
      I'll guide you through the process using data and machine learning to make informed decisions.
      This first part focuses on understanding how property values are determined in Tokyo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start by looking at how property values have evolved in Tokyo over the past decade. The chart
      below shows the average land and house values per square meter from 2013 to 2024:
    </p>

    <p>
      As shown in the chart, both land and house values in Tokyo have shown significant upward trends,
      but with some interesting differences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Land Values:</strong> From 2013 to 2024, the average land value per square meter has
        increased from ¥425,101 to ¥619,906, representing a total increase of approximately 46%.
        This trend highlights the strong demand for land in Tokyo and the potential for long-term
        value appreciation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>House Values:</strong> House values have shown an even more dramatic increase, rising
        from ¥60,523 to ¥180,541 per square meter, representing a total increase of approximately
        198%. This suggests that the value of buildings themselves has increased significantly,
        possibly due to improvements in construction quality, energy efficiency, and modern amenities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The chart also reveals some interesting patterns, such as the temporary dip in land values in
      2014-2015, and the accelerated growth in both land and house values in recent years. These
      trends are important to consider when evaluating the potential return on investment in Tokyo's
      real estate market.

    <h2>The Tokyo Property Landscape</h2>
    <p>
      Let's start by looking at the distribution of land values across Tokyo. The map below shows
      the relative value of land in different areas, based on data from the Ministry of Land,
      Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT).

    <h2>Key Factors Affecting Property Values</h2>
    
    <div class="factor location">
      <h3>Location, Location, Location</h3>
      <p>
        As in any major city, location is the most significant factor in determining property values.
        Our analysis of MLIT data shows that properties in central Tokyo can be worth up to 150% more
        than similar properties in outer areas.
      </p>
      <div class="graph-container">
        <!-- Location impact graph will go here -->
      </div>
      <h2>Location Factors</h2>
      <p>
        The location of a property is one of the most significant factors affecting its value in
        Tokyo. Our analysis reveals several key location-based factors that influence property
        prices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Walking Time to Station:</strong> One of the most important factors in Tokyo's
          real estate market is the walking time to the nearest train station. Our analysis shows a
          complex relationship between walking time and property values, with 10 minutes as the reference point. The scatter plot below shows how
          different walking times affect land values, with a trend line showing the general pattern:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <app-walking-time-chart></app-walking-time-chart>
      <p>
        The visualization reveals several interesting patterns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Optimal Range:</strong> Properties within 0-5 minutes of a station command the
          highest premiums, with values up to +¥124,758 per square meter above the reference point.
          This reflects the high demand for extremely convenient locations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Steep Decline:</strong> Beyond 15 minutes, there's a significant negative impact
          on property values, with properties 20+ minutes away showing decreases of over
          ¥500,000 per square meter compared to the reference point. The trend line shows a clear
          negative correlation between walking time and property value, with an average devaluation
          rate of approximately ¥15,000 per square meter per minute of additional walking time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Variability:</strong> There's notable variation in the impact at similar walking
          times (shown by the spread of points around the trend line), suggesting that other factors
          like station importance, train lines, and neighborhood characteristics also play a role.
          The trend line helps visualize the general pattern despite this variability.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data demonstrates the premium that buyers are willing to pay for convenience and
        accessibility to public transportation in Tokyo. Properties within a 5-minute walk of a
        station command the highest values, while those beyond 15 minutes show significant
        discounts. The trend line shows that, on average, each additional minute of walking time
        has a substantial impact on property values, though the relationship is not perfectly linear
        due to the influence of other factors.

      <h3>Building Type and Depreciation</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most interesting findings from our analysis is how different building materials
        depreciate over time. Using MLIT data, we were able to model the depreciation curves for
        different construction types, with NA (unknown/other) as the reference point. The graph below
        shows how the value per square meter changes over time for each type of construction:
      </p>
      <app-depreciation-graph></app-depreciation-graph>
      <p>
        The analysis reveals several key insights about building depreciation in Tokyo:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Initial Values:</strong> Steel structures (鉄骨造) command the highest initial value
          at +¥93,437 per square meter above the reference, followed by light steel structures
          (軽量鉄骨造) at +¥56,795 per square meter. Interestingly, wooden structures (木造) start
          with a negative value of -¥9,408 per square meter compared to the reference.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Depreciation Rates:</strong> Light steel structures show the fastest depreciation
          rate at -¥12,059 per square meter per year, followed by steel structures at -¥8,526 per
          year, and wooden structures at -¥8,197 per year. This means that while steel structures
          start with a much higher value, they lose value more quickly than wooden structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Value Crossover:</strong> Due to the combination of higher initial values and
          faster depreciation rates, steel and light steel structures eventually cross over with
          wooden structures in terms of value. This is an important consideration when evaluating
          older properties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These findings suggest that while steel structures might be more attractive for new
        construction, wooden structures might be a better choice for long-term investment due to
        their lower initial cost and slower depreciation rate. Light steel structures, despite
        their lower initial cost compared to full steel structures, show the fastest depreciation
        rate, which might make them less attractive for long-term investments.

    <div class="factor land-characteristics">
      <h3>Land Characteristics</h3>
      <p>
        The physical characteristics of the land itself play a crucial role in determining its value.
        Our analysis revealed several key factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Land Size (土地面積):</strong> While larger plots generally command higher total prices,
          the price per square meter often decreases as the plot size increases. This is known as the
          "plottage effect" - the ability to build larger, more efficient structures on bigger plots.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Floor Ratio (容積率):</strong> The floor ratio, which determines how much building
          area can be constructed relative to the land area, has a significant impact on land value.
          Our analysis shows that the standard reference ratio of 150% serves as a baseline, with
          higher ratios generally increasing land value and lower ratios decreasing it. The chart
          below illustrates this relationship:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <app-floor-ratio-chart></app-floor-ratio-chart>
      <p>
        As shown in the chart, the floor ratio has a non-linear relationship with land value. While
        ratios below 100% tend to decrease land value, ratios above 200% show increasingly positive
        impacts on value. This reflects the development potential of the land and its ability to
        generate more usable space.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Building Ratio (建ぺい率):</strong> The building ratio, which determines how much
          of the land area can be covered by buildings, also significantly affects land value. Our
          analysis shows that the standard reference ratio of 60% serves as a baseline, with higher
          ratios generally increasing land value and lower ratios decreasing it. The chart below
          illustrates this relationship:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <app-building-ratio-chart></app-building-ratio-chart>
      <p>
        As shown in the chart, the building ratio has a clear impact on land value. Ratios below
        60% tend to decrease land value, while higher ratios can significantly increase it. This
        reflects the development potential of the land and its ability to accommodate larger
        buildings.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Land Shape and Topography:</strong> The shape of the land has a significant impact
          on its value. Our analysis shows that using square-shaped land (正方形) as the reference point,
          landlocked properties (袋地等) and irregular shapes (不整形) have the most negative impact on value, with
          decreases of over ¥62,000 per square meter. On the other hand, regular rectangular shapes
          (長方形) and near-rectangular shapes (ほぼ長方形) have a positive impact of around ¥2,500-2,900
          per square meter. This reflects the importance of buildability and efficient land use in
          determining property values.
        </li>

        determining property values.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Land Orientation:</strong> The orientation of the land relative to the road also
          affects its value. Our analysis shows that using east-facing properties (東) as the reference point, properties
          with no road frontage (接面道路無) have the most negative impact on value, with a decrease of
          over ¥238,000 per square meter. South-east facing properties (南東) have the most positive
          impact at +¥10,038 per m², followed by south-facing (南) at +¥9,022 per m². This reflects
          the strong preference for south-facing properties in Japan due to better sunlight exposure.
